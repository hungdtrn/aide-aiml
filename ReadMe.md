## GitHub source code repositories

Our ML/A.I hack-a-thon competition entry is contained entirely within the following Git repository.  Development started on 2023-11-18 at 11 am.

**AIDE open-source code repository:** [https://github.com/shaneantonio/aide-aiml](https://github.com/shaneantonio/aide-aiml)

The pre-existing **general purpose, open-source** distributed system framework used to create the AIDE voice user interface services has been developed by team member Andy Gelme and others over many years.  During the week of 2023-11-18, Andy built-out additional [audio streaming capabilities here](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_services/tree/master/examples/speech).

Andy spoke with the ML/A.I hack-a-thon organizers prior to the event to ensure that using an existing open-source framework developed by a team member was acceptable.  Just like any other pre-existing open-source software that is freely available to all.

**Aiko Services open-source framework:** [https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_services](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_services)
